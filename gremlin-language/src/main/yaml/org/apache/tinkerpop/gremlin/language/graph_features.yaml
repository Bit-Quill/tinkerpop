    Note: many graph features have to do with writes (i.e. whether adds or removals of a given kind are allowed).
          These are excluded from the current data types, though noted below.
          Also note that these types rearrange the features somewhat, preserving information.
  - >
    Excluded ElementFeatures (vertex and edge):
      FEATURE_ADD_PROPERTY, FEATURE_REMOVE_PROPERTY, FEATURE_CUSTOM_IDS, FEATURE_USER_SUPPLIED_IDS
  - >
    Excluded EdgeFeatures:
      FEATURE_ADD_EDGES, FEATURE_REMOVE_EDGES
  - >
    Excluded VertexFeatures:
      FEATURE_ADD_VERTICES, FEATURE_REMOVE_VERTICES
  - >
    Excluded DataTypeFeatures: none
  - >
    Excluded GraphFeatures: all of them, i.e.
      FEATURE_COMPUTER, FEATURE_CONCURRENT_ACCESS, FEATURE_PERSISTENCE, FEATURE_THREADED_TRANSACTIONS, FEATURE_TRANSACTIONS

        - name: map
          description: >
            The type of map values. The map can contain arbitrary serializable values
            that may or may not be defined as features themselves.

        - name: mixedList
          description: >
            The type of a mixed list; as such lists are "mixed", they may contain objects of different types.
            These objects may be arbitrary serializable values that may or may not be defined as features themselves.

        - name: serializable
          description: "The type of a Java serializable value"

        - name: uniformList
          description: >
            The type of a uniform list; as such lists are "uniform", they must contain objects of the same type.
            These objects may be arbitrary serializable values that may or may not be defined as features themselves.

        - name: supportsVertexProperties
          description: >
            Determines whether a Vertex allows for the processing of at least one data type defined by the features.
            In this case "processing" refers to at least "reading" the data type.

        - name: supportsEdgeProperties
          description: >
            Determines whether an Edge allows for the processing of at least one data type defined by the features.
            In this case "processing" refers to at least "reading" the data type.

        - name: supportsVertexMetaProperties
          description: >
            Determines whether a Vertex can support properties on vertex properties.

        - name: supportsVertexMultiProperties
          description: >
            Determines whether a Vertex can support multiple properties with the same key.

        - name: supportsDataTypes
          description: >
            This bundles together individual features relating to supported property value types.
