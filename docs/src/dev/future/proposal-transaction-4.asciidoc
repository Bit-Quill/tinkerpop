*x.y.z - Proposal 4*

== Tinkerpop native transaction support

=== Introduction
Now, if you need to use transactions in tinkerpop, the only solution is to use the Neo4j plugin. Unfortunately, this plugin has not been updated for a long time and is only compatible with Neo4j version 3.4, which reached end of life in March 2020.

=== Motivation
We would like to propose to implement native Tinkerpop transaction support. Users will be able to use transactions without the outdated Neo4j plugin.

=== Assumptions

* Need to reuse existing code as much as possible.
* Users should be able to work both with and without transactions.
* Transaction implementation should not have additional external dependencies.
* Existing drivers should work without changes.

=== Specifications
==== Design Overview
The main changes relate to TinkerGraph, we need to make a similar solution but with transaction support. I think TinkerGraph should be unchanged because for many users performance will be more important.
I think by default I can make 2 configurations on Gremlin Server and users themselves will choose what they need, TinkerGraph or TinkerTransactionGraph.
I'm thinking of using write-only locks to reduce the impact of transactions on performance. In this case the isolation level will be `read committed`, the same as now with the Neo4j plugin. 
I plan to only support ThreadLocalTransaction, therefore embedded graph transactions may not be fully supported.

==== Overview of changes to code base
===== ElementContainer
Storage for current Element value and ThreadLocal updated value with `isDeleted` flag. Similar for `Vertices` and `Edges`.
[code]
----
class ElementContainer {
    Vertex current;
    ThreadLocal<Vertex> transactionUpdatedValue;
    ThreadLocal<Boolean> isDeleted;
}
----

===== TinkerTransactionGraph
Vertices and Edges will store with version number and dirty transaction values
`Map<Object, ElementContainer> vertices` where `Object` is Vertex Id.
Shared code with TinkerGraph will be moved to AbstractTinkerGraph.

===== TinkerTransactionElement
Add `currentVersion` to all TinkerElements. This is the number of the transaction that last updated it.

===== TinkerThreadLocalTransaction
Extension of AbstractThreadLocalTransaction. Add a unique transaction number. Can use `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet`

===== Graph Feature files
Add TinkerTransactionGraphFeatures, TinkerTransactionGraphVertexFeatures, TinkerTransactionGraphEdgeFeatures, TinkerTransactionGraphGraphFeatures, TinkerTransactionGraphVertexPropertyFeatures.

==== CRUD operations without transaction
1. Wrap into transaction
2. Commit

==== CRUD operations with transaction
===== Create
Add new ElementContainer to `vertices` and `edges` in TinkerTransactionGraph.

==== Read
Read values from `vertices` ElementContainer, `transactionUpdatedValue` if present, otherwise `current`.
if `isDeleted` flag is set, then the element is deleted in transaction and should be skipped.

===== Update
Update corresponding ElementContainer  in `vertices`.

===== Delete
Set `isDeleted` flag in ElementContainer  in `vertices`.

==== Transaction flows
===== Commit flow
To reduce lock time double-checked locking used.
1. Make list of all affected elements sorted by transaction#. The reason is to reduce the lock time.
2. If any has a newer version, then fail.
3. Try to lock all Vertices/Edges changed in transaction. For vertex delete operation also need to lock adjacent edges. Lock is for write operations only. If some Vertex/Edge is already locked then fail.
4. Check versions again, fail if some element is updated. Code: `Vertices.get(id).current()).currentVersion() !=Vertices.get(id).transactionUpdatedValue().currentVersion()`
5. For all Elements replace current version with value updated in transaction (or remove Element on Delete operation). Cleanup `transactionUpdatedValue`.
6. Change version of all updated Elements.
7. Unlock.
8. Update indexes if needed.

===== Rollback
Cleanup `transactionUpdatedValue` in `vertices`

===== Error
On any error, including transaction conflict:
1. Rollback
2. Throw exception

===== Timeout
Add transactionWatchdog which will rollback locked/expired transactions. Similar to `Session.touch`.
1. If the transaction was open longer than some preconfigured (default 10-20 minutes?) time.
2. If the transaction start commit, but not finish (default 1-2 seconds?).

==== Additional changes
Split TinkerFactory into AbstractTinkerFactory and TinkerFactory, add TinkerTransactionGraphFactory.
